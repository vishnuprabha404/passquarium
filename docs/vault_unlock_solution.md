# Vault Unlock Problem Resolution

**Date:** January 21, 2025  
**Time:** 1:30 AM  
**Problem:** Users couldn't add passwords due to "Vault not unlocked" errors  
**Solution:** Implemented singleton pattern for EncryptionService

## Problem Description

Users were getting this error when trying to add passwords:
```
Error: Exception: Failed to save password
```

Debug logs showed:
```
[DEBUG] PasswordService: Vault unlocked status: false
[DEBUG] EncryptionService: _cachedVaultKey is null: true
[DEBUG] EncryptionService: Current user ID: null
[ERROR] EncryptionService: Vault not unlocked!
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Multiple Service Instances
Each service was creating its own `EncryptionService` instance:
- `AuthService`: `final EncryptionService _encryptionService = EncryptionService();`
- `PasswordService`: `final EncryptionService _encryptionService = EncryptionService();`

**Result:** Vault key cached in one instance, not available in others.

### 2. Missing setCachedVaultKey Method
`EncryptionService` lacked method to set vault key externally:
- `AuthService` couldn't set vault key in `EncryptionService` instance
- `PasswordService` couldn't access vault key set by `AuthService`

### 3. Incomplete Vault Key Flow
Vault key was unlocked but not properly cached for reuse:
- Login unlocked vault key but didn't persist it across service boundaries
- Password operations failed because vault key wasn't available

## Technical Solution

### 1. Singleton Pattern for EncryptionService

```dart
class EncryptionService {
  // Singleton pattern
  static final EncryptionService _instance = EncryptionService._internal();
  factory EncryptionService() => _instance;
  EncryptionService._internal();
  
  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

### 2. Added setCachedVaultKey Method

```dart
void setCachedVaultKey(Uint8List vaultKey, String userId) {
  _cachedVaultKey = vaultKey;
  _currentUserId = userId;
  print('[DEBUG] EncryptionService: Vault key cached for user: $userId');
}
```

### 3. Fixed AuthService Vault Key Caching

```dart
// Before: Creating new instance
EncryptionService().setCachedVaultKey(_cachedVaultKey!);

// After: Using existing instance
_encryptionService.setCachedVaultKey(_cachedVaultKey!, _firebaseUser!.uid);
```

### 4. Complete Vault Key Flow

```dart
// On login:
await _keyService.initializeVaultKeyForUser(_firebaseUser!.uid, password);
_cachedVaultKey = await _keyService.unlockVaultKeyForUser(_firebaseUser!.uid, password);
_encryptionService.setCachedVaultKey(_cachedVaultKey!, _firebaseUser!.uid);

// On password operations:
final encryptedPassword = await _encryptionService.encryptPassword(password);
```

## Vault Key Architecture

✅ **KeyService**: Handles vault key generation, encryption, and Firestore storage  
✅ **EncryptionService**: Singleton that caches unlocked vault key for all operations  
✅ **AuthService**: Initializes and unlocks vault key, sets it in EncryptionService  
✅ **PasswordService**: Uses cached vault key from EncryptionService for encryption  

## Security Benefits

- Vault key never leaves device unencrypted
- Single instance prevents multiple vault key copies in memory
- User-specific vault key isolation
- Proper cleanup when vault is locked

## Debug Logs Comparison

### Before Fix:
```
[DEBUG] PasswordService: Vault unlocked status: false
[DEBUG] EncryptionService: _cachedVaultKey is null: true
[DEBUG] EncryptionService: Current user ID: null
[ERROR] EncryptionService: Vault not unlocked!
```

### After Fix:
```
[DEBUG] Vault key initialized successfully for user: 3mCeukAbynYWgydRN5C7o1pHBbB3
[DEBUG] Vault unlocked successfully for user: 3mCeukAbynYWgydRN5C7o1pHBbB3
[DEBUG] EncryptionService: Vault key cached for user: 3mCeukAbynYWgydRN5C7o1pHBbB3
[DEBUG] PasswordService: Password encrypted successfully
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Service Instance Management**: Always consider whether services should be singletons
2. **State Sharing**: Services that need to share state should use same instance
3. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify state management issues
4. **Vault Key Lifecycle**: Proper initialization → unlocking → caching → usage flow
5. **User Context**: Always associate vault keys with specific user IDs

## Future Reference

- When adding new services that need vault key access, use `EncryptionService()` singleton
- Always set user ID when caching vault key for proper isolation
- Monitor debug logs for vault key state during authentication and password operations
- Singleton pattern is essential for services that need to share state across app

## Testing Verification

✅ Vault key initialization works on first login  
✅ Vault key unlocking works on subsequent logins  
✅ Vault key caching persists across service calls  
✅ Password encryption works with cached vault key  
✅ No more "Vault not unlocked" errors during password operations  

## Files Modified

- `lib/services/encryption_service.dart`: Added singleton pattern and setCachedVaultKey method
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart`: Fixed vault key caching calls
- `lib/services/password_service.dart`: Now uses singleton EncryptionService

## Impact

- **Before**: Users couldn't add passwords due to vault unlock failures
- **After**: Complete password management functionality working
- **Security**: Maintained while fixing functionality
- **Performance**: Improved with proper caching
