WHY IT WAS DONE:
- GitHub rejects files larger than 100MB (file was 487MB)
- Heap dump files are debug artifacts that shouldn't be version controlled
- Clean Git history is essential for repository maintenance
- Prevent future accidental commits of large debug files

HOW IT MAKES SENSE:
- Git filter-branch rewrites history to completely remove large files
- .gitignore prevents future tracking of debug files (*.hprof, *.heap, *.prof, *.trace)

===============================================================================
                          BUILD ERRORS & SOLUTIONS REFERENCE
===============================================================================

=== WINDOWS BUILD ERRORS & SOLUTIONS ===

ERROR 1: CMake Build Failures
SYMPTOM: "CMake Error: target_link_libraries called with incorrect number of arguments"
CAUSE: Incompatible CMake syntax between Flutter versions and Visual Studio
SOLUTION: 
- Regenerated Windows platform files: `flutter create --platforms=windows .`
- Updated CMakeLists.txt with proper target_link_libraries syntax
- Added missing dwmapi library for Windows API functions
WHY: Flutter's Windows CMake configuration can become corrupted or outdated, requiring regeneration with current Flutter version

ERROR 2: Firebase C++ SDK Conflicts
SYMPTOM: Windows build fails with Firebase linking errors
CAUSE: Firebase C++ SDK not compatible with Windows desktop builds
SOLUTION:
- Temporarily disabled Firebase imports for Windows builds
- Used conditional imports based on platform
- Moved firestore_service.dart to .bak file during Windows testing
WHY: Firebase Flutter plugins primarily target mobile platforms; desktop support is limited

ERROR 3: Missing Dependencies & Libraries
SYMPTOM: Unresolved external symbols, missing .lib files
CAUSE: Windows-specific libraries not properly linked
SOLUTION:
- Added WIN32_EXECUTABLE property to CMakeLists.txt
- Ensured proper subsystem settings for main function
- Verified Visual Studio C++ tools installation
WHY: Windows desktop apps require specific linking configuration for proper executable generation

=== ANDROID BUILD ERRORS & SOLUTIONS ===

ERROR 1: Gradle Plugin Application Method Deprecated
SYMPTOM: "You are applying Flutter's app_plugin_loader Gradle plugin imperatively using the apply script method, which is not possible anymore"
CAUSE: Flutter 3.32.4 requires declarative plugins block instead of imperative apply statements
SOLUTION:
- Updated android/settings.gradle with pluginManagement block
- Migrated to plugins {} block in app/build.gradle
- Removed apply plugin statements
WHY: Modern Gradle and Flutter versions enforce declarative plugin syntax for better dependency management and build reproducibility

ERROR 2: Boolean Property Parsing Error
SYMPTOM: "Cannot parse project property android.enableJetifier='true ' of type 'class java.lang.String' as boolean"
CAUSE: Trailing space in gradle.properties file
SOLUTION:
- Recreated android/gradle.properties file without trailing spaces
- Used PowerShell here-string to ensure clean formatting
WHY: Gradle strictly parses boolean values and any whitespace causes type conversion failures

ERROR 3: Version Compatibility Issues
SYMPTOM: Multiple warnings about outdated Gradle, Kotlin, and Android Gradle Plugin versions
CAUSE: Project created with older Flutter template, versions not compatible with Flutter 3.32.4
SOLUTION:
- Updated Android Gradle Plugin: 8.1.4 → 8.3.0
- Updated Gradle wrapper: 8.3 → 8.4  
- Updated Kotlin: 1.7.10 → 1.8.10
- Added version declarations in both settings.gradle and build.gradle
WHY: Flutter 3.32.4 requires minimum versions for compatibility and modern build features

ERROR 4: Missing Namespace Declaration
SYMPTOM: "Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file"
CAUSE: Modern Android Gradle Plugin requires explicit namespace declaration
SOLUTION:
- Added `namespace "com.example.super_locker"` to android block in app/build.gradle
- Removed package attribute from AndroidManifest.xml (deprecated)
WHY: Android build system moved from manifest-based package declaration to build.gradle namespace for better build consistency

ERROR 5: Gradle Version Mismatch
SYMPTOM: "Minimum supported Gradle version is 8.4. Current version is 8.3"
CAUSE: Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.0 requires Gradle 8.4+
SOLUTION:
- Updated gradle-wrapper.properties: gradle-8.3-all.zip → gradle-8.4-all.zip
WHY: Each Android Gradle Plugin version has specific Gradle version requirements for compatibility

ERROR 6: Duplicate Gradle Configuration Files & Java Heap Space Error
SYMPTOM: "Both settings.gradle and settings.gradle.kts exist, so settings.gradle.kts is ignored. This is likely a mistake." + "Java heap space" error during JetifyTransform of x86_64_debug jar
CAUSE: Conflicting Gradle configuration files and insufficient JVM memory for Jetify transformation of Flutter engine binaries
SOLUTION:
- Removed duplicate files: `android/settings.gradle.kts` and `android/build.gradle.kts`
- Increased JVM heap memory in gradle.properties: `-Xmx1536M` → `-Xmx6144M`
- Added memory management flags: `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024M -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`
- Disabled Jetifier: `android.enableJetifier=false` (since project uses AndroidX)
- Cleared Gradle cache: `rmdir /s /q %USERPROFILE%\.gradle\caches`
- Performed clean builds: `flutter clean` and `./gradlew clean`
WHY: Duplicate configuration files cause build system confusion, and Jetify transformation of large Flutter engine binaries requires significant memory. Modern projects using AndroidX don't need Jetifier for legacy support library conversion.

=== CONFIGURATION FILES UPDATED ===

1. android/settings.gradle:
   - Added pluginManagement block with Flutter SDK path resolution
   - Configured repositories (google, mavenCentral, gradlePluginPortal)
   - Declared plugins with versions (flutter-plugin-loader, android.application, kotlin.android)

2. android/app/build.gradle:
   - Replaced apply plugin statements with plugins {} block
   - Added namespace declaration
   - Removed deprecated apply from flutter.gradle

3. android/build.gradle:
   - Updated kotlin_version from 1.7.10 to 1.8.10
   - Updated Android Gradle Plugin from 8.1.4 to 8.3.0

4. android/gradle.properties:
   - Removed trailing spaces from boolean properties
   - Ensured clean UTF-8 encoding

5. android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties:
   - Updated Gradle distribution from 8.3 to 8.4

=== LESSONS LEARNED ===

1. Flutter Version Compatibility:
   - Always check Flutter release notes for breaking changes
   - Modern Flutter versions enforce stricter build configurations
   - Platform-specific code may need updates with Flutter upgrades

2. Gradle Build System Evolution:
   - Android build tools continuously evolve with stricter requirements
   - Declarative syntax preferred over imperative for maintainability
   - Version dependencies are tightly coupled and must be updated together

3. Cross-Platform Considerations:
   - Firebase and other plugins may have platform-specific limitations
   - Desktop platforms (Windows) have different dependency requirements than mobile
   - Conditional compilation may be necessary for platform-specific features

4. Error Diagnosis Strategy:
   - Read error messages carefully for specific version requirements
   - Check official documentation for migration guides
   - Use flutter clean between configuration changes
   - Verify all related version dependencies when updating one component

ERROR 7: Large File Git Push Error
SYMPTOM: "File android/java_pid14980.hprof is 464.90 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB"
CAUSE: Large debug/profiling files (heap dumps) committed to repository
SOLUTION:
- Remove file from filesystem: `rm android/java_pid14980.hprof`
- Update .gitignore with debug file patterns: `*.hprof`, `*.heap`, `*.prof`, `*.trace`
- Remove from Git cache: `git rm --cached android/java_pid14980.hprof`  
- Clean Git history: `git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch android/java_pid14980.hprof' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all`
- Clean up repository: `git reflog expire --expire=now --all` and `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`
- Force push: `git push --force-with-lease origin master`
WHY: GitHub enforces 100MB file size limit; debug files shouldn't be version controlled; filter-branch completely removes files from all Git history

=== FUTURE REFERENCE COMMANDS ===

Windows Build:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
flutter build windows --release
```

Android Build:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d emulator-5554
flutter build apk --debug
flutter build apk --release
```

Troubleshooting:
```bash
flutter doctor -v
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
flutter devices
```
